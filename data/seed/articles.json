    "body": "# Getting Started with Claude Code\n\nClaude Code is a powerful CLI tool that brings AI-assisted development directly to your terminal. Unlike traditional chatbots, Claude Code understands your entire codebase and can make changes across multiple files.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code\n```\n\n## First Steps\n\n1. Navigate to your project directory\n2. Run `claude` to start an interactive session\n3. Ask Claude to explore your codebase\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Codebase awareness**: Claude reads and understands your entire project\n- **Multi-file editing**: Make coordinated changes across files\n- **Git integration**: Commit, review, and manage PRs\n- **Extensible**: Add custom commands and MCP servers\n\n## Your First Task\n\nTry asking Claude: \"What does this project do and what's its structure?\"\n\nClaude will explore your codebase and give you a comprehensive overview. From there, you can start making changes, fixing bugs, or adding features.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Learn about Plan Mode for complex tasks\n- Explore custom commands in `.claude/commands/`\n- Set up MCP servers for external integrations",

Here's how to get the most out of your AI coding assistant.\n\n## The Anatomy of a Good Prompt\n\n1. **Be specific**: Instead of \"fix the bug\", say \"fix the null pointer exception in UserService.getUserById\"\n2. **Provide context**: Reference specific files with `@filename`\n3. **State your constraints**: \"Use TypeScript, follow existing patterns\"\n4. **Define success**: \"The test should pass after the fix\"\n\n## Examples\n\n### Bad Prompt\n```\nMake the code better\n```\n\n### Good Prompt\n```\nRefactor the authentication flow in @src/auth/auth.service.ts to:\n1. Use async/await consistently\n2. Add proper error handling\n3. Follow the existing error pattern in @src/common/errors.ts\n```\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Chain of Thought\nAsk Claude to think step by step for complex problems:\n```\nAnalyze the performance issue in the article listing endpoint. \nFirst, identify the bottleneck, then propose solutions.\n```\n\n### Negative Prompting\nTell Claude what NOT to do:\n```\nAdd validation to this form. Don't use any external libraries.\n```\n\n## Practice Makes Perfect\n\nStart simple and iterate. Watch how Claude interprets your prompts and adjust accordingly.",

Use @file References\n```\nLook at @src/auth/auth.service.ts and @src/auth/auth.controller.ts\n```\nThis tells Claude exactly what to focus on.\n\n### 2. Leverage CLAUDE.md\nYour project's CLAUDE.md file gives Claude persistent context about:\n- Project structure\n- Coding conventions\n- Common commands\n\n### 3. Work in Focused Sessions\nInstead of:\n```\nRefactor the entire codebase\n```\n\nTry:\n```\nRefactor the authentication module\n```\n\n### 4. Use Summarization\nAsk Claude to summarize large files before working on them.\n\n## Monitoring Context Usage\n\nClaude Code shows context usage in the status bar. Watch for:\n- Files being read\n- Conversation history size\n- Tool outputs\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Start fresh sessions for new tasks\n2. Be specific about what files to read\n3.

Claude analyzed our codebase and suddenly understood our project.\n\n## Day 2: First Real Task\n\nBug report: \"Users can't update their profile\"\n\nOld approach: Grep through code, add console.logs, spend 2 hours.\n\nWith Claude:\n```\nUsers report they can't update profiles.\nFind and fix the issue.\n```\n\n20 minutes. Bug found. Fixed. Tested.\n\n## Day 3: The Wow Moment\n\nAsked Claude to add a new endpoint. Watched it:\n1. Read existing patterns\n2. Create controller method\n3. Update service\n4. Add DTO validation\n5. Generate tests\n\nAll consistent with our codebase. Mind blown.\n\n## Day 4: Learning Prompting\n\nRealized my prompts were too vague. Started being specific:\n- Reference files\n- State constraints\n- Define success\n\nResults improved dramatically.\n\n## Day 5: Team Adoption\n\nShared my experience. Skeptics became curious.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n1. The learning curve is real but short\n2. Be specific in prompts\n3. Trust but verify\n4. It's an augmentation, not replacement\n5.

[y/n]\"\n```\n\n## Auto-Edit Mode\n\n**How it works**: Claude makes changes without asking.\n\n**Activate**: Press `Ctrl+E` or select in settings\n\n**Use when**:\n- You trust the changes\n- Making many edits\n- Time is critical\n- Working on non-critical code\n\n**Safety**: Changes are tracked in git, easy to undo.\n\n## Plan Mode\n\n**How it works**: Claude can only read, not write.\n\n**Activate**: Press `Ctrl+P` or `/plan`\n\n**Use when**:\n- Exploring unfamiliar code\n- Planning large changes\n- Investigating bugs\n- Learning the codebase\n\n## Mode Comparison\n\n| Aspect | Normal | Auto-Edit | Plan |\n|--------|--------|-----------|------|\n| Read | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Write | With approval | Automatic | No |\n| Speed | Slower | Faster | N/A |\n| Control | High | Low | N/A |\n| Risk | Low | Medium | None |\n\n## Switching Modes\n\n- `Ctrl+P`: Toggle Plan Mode\n- `Ctrl+E`: Toggle Auto-Edit\n- `/plan`: Enter Plan Mode\n- `/edit`: Enter Normal Mode\n\n## Best Practice\n\nStart in Plan Mode → understand → switch to appropriate edit mode.",
